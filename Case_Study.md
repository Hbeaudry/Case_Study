# Carta’s Disruption in the FinTech Industry

   Carta, formerly known as eShares Inc., was founded in 2012 by Henry Ward and Manu Kumar. The company was originally started when the founders noticed the world was moving away from physical copies of records and into the “cloud”. This is where the founders capitalized on the need from venture backed companies for the electronic management of equity, track capital tables, as well as issue securities. By 2013, the company raise 1.8 million dollars from a large group of investors. Carta soon moved into 409A valuations in 2014 to provide their customers and clients with timely, cost-effective valuations. Flash forward to today, Carta is primarily known as a being a management company that helps investors and companies manage equity and ownership. Since 2012, Carta has raised $1.2 billion through 10 rounds of funding by 86 different investors. 
Carta helps private companies easily manage the ownership of shares and options, as well as valuations through their platform. They manage capital tables for almost 30,000 startups, their primary target market, which has helped lead to the company receiving a $7.4 billion valuation.  Although Carta offers startups and privately owned companies an easy way to manage equity, they also work with public companies and investment firms.
Carta is in the Investment and wealth Management FinTech domain, but there are other big players in this area that Carta competes with, such as Techstars, Affinity Development group Inc, and Plaid Inc. The advantage that Carta holds over competitors includes many factors such as the registered patents they hold, the amount of time the company has been around, the multitude of services they provide, the moderate overhead cost, and the amount of customers they currently hold. As a company, they use over 60 technological products and services, such as Jquery, CloudFlare, and HTML5, to run their website. Carta’s 2 registered patents and 6 trademarks gives them a huge advantage over all other companies in this space, making them one of the leading companies in this space and allowing them to outperform their competition.
Personally, I don’t have any new products or services that I would suggest Carta to offer, as they already offer many services in this industry. Instead, I would suggest that Carta completely stops offering services to employees of and all public companies altogether, as this was a big risk they took and has been unsuccessful so far. Carta has created their success as a company through helping private startups and I believe they should scale back and make that their primary focus.
